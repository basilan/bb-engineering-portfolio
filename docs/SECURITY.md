# Security Guidelines for AI/ML Reference Implementations

## üîí Security Philosophy

**Security as Job Zero**: These reference implementations prioritize security from initial design through deployment, following enterprise-grade security practices while maintaining educational accessibility.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework

### Core Security Principles
1. **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal necessary permissions only
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
4. **Security by Design**: Security considerations in every development decision
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated scanning and alerting
6. **Synthetic Data Only**: Never use real customer or sensitive data

---

## üîê Implementation Security Standards

### **API Key & Credential Management**
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER commit secrets to repository
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # Wrong!

# ‚úÖ Always use environment variables or secure parameter stores
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id openai-key --query SecretString --output text)
```

**Required Practices**:
- All API keys via environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatic credential rotation where possible
- No hardcoded secrets in code, configuration, or documentation
- `.env` files in `.gitignore` with `.env.example` templates

### **AWS Infrastructure Security**
```terraform
# Terraform Security Baseline
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "demo_bucket" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}

# IAM Least Privilege
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "lambda_minimal" {
  name = "lambda-minimal-permissions"
  role = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject"
        ]
        Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### **Data Protection Standards**
- **Encryption at Rest**: All S3 buckets, databases, and storage encrypted
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all API communications
- **Data Classification**: Clear labeling of synthetic vs sensitive data
- **Data Retention**: Automatic cleanup of demo data (7-day lifecycle)
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Deploy only in approved AWS regions

### **Network Security**
```terraform
# Private subnets for sensitive resources
resource "aws_subnet" "private" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.demo_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  
  map_public_ip_on_launch = false
  
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet-demo"
    Type = "private"
  }
}

# Security groups with minimal access
resource "aws_security_group" "lambda_sg" {
  name_prefix = "lambda-demo-"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.demo_vpc.id

  egress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    description = "HTTPS outbound only"
  }
}
```

## üö® Automated Security Scanning

### **Required Security Checks in CI/CD**
```yaml
# GitHub Actions Security Pipeline
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    # Python dependency vulnerability scanning
    - name: Security Scan - Python
      run: |
        pip install safety bandit
        safety check --json
        bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
    
    # Secrets scanning
    - name: Secrets Scan
      uses: gitguardian/ggshield-action@v1
      env:
        GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY }}
    
    # Infrastructure security scan
    - name: Terraform Security Scan
      uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action@v1.0.0
      with:
        working_directory: terraform/
```

### **Security Quality Gates**
- **Zero High/Critical Vulnerabilities**: Automated blocking of deployments
- **Dependency Scanning**: All Python packages scanned for known vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Detection**: No committed API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Terraform configurations validated for security best practices

---

## üîç Monitoring & Incident Response

### **Security Monitoring**
```terraform
# CloudTrail for audit logging
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "demo_trail" {
  name           = "demo-security-trail"
  s3_bucket_name = aws_s3_bucket.cloudtrail_bucket.id
  
  event_selector {
    read_write_type           = "All"
    include_management_events = true
    
    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["${aws_s3_bucket.demo_bucket.arn}/*"]
    }
  }
}

# CloudWatch alerts for suspicious activity
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "unauthorized_api_calls" {
  alarm_name          = "unauthorized-api-calls"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "ErrorCount"
  namespace           = "AWS/ApiGateway"
  period              = "300"
  statistic           = "Sum"
  threshold           = "10"
  alarm_description   = "This metric monitors unauthorized API calls"
}
```

### **Incident Response Plan**
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts via CloudWatch and security scanning
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact within 1 hour
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected resources immediately
4. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerabilities and harden systems
5. **Recovery**: Restore services with enhanced security
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security practices and documentation

## üë• Contributor Security Guidelines

### **Developer Security Responsibilities**
- **Never commit sensitive data**: API keys, passwords, customer information
- **Use synthetic data only**: Create realistic but fake data for demonstrations
- **Follow secure coding practices**: Input validation, error handling, logging
- **Run security scans locally**: Before submitting pull requests
- **Report security issues immediately**: Private disclosure via security contacts

### **Secure Development Workflow**
```bash
# Before committing code
make security-scan-local    # Run local vulnerability scans
make secrets-check         # Verify no secrets in code
make test-security         # Run security-focused tests
git commit -m "feat: secure implementation of X"
```

### **Security Code Review Checklist**
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging excludes sensitive data
- [ ] Infrastructure follows least privilege principles
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and vulnerability-free

## üìã Compliance & Governance

### **Regulatory Considerations**
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, synthetic data only, right to deletion
- **SOC 2**: Security controls documentation and audit trails
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management practices
- **NIST Framework**: Security controls aligned with industry standards

### **Data Governance**
```python
# Data classification and handling
class DataClassification:
    SYNTHETIC = "synthetic"  # ‚úÖ Allowed in demos
    INTERNAL = "internal"    # ‚ùå Never in public repos
    CUSTOMER = "customer"    # ‚ùå Absolutely forbidden
    
# Example synthetic data generation
def generate_synthetic_claims_data():
    """Generate realistic but fake medical claims data."""
    return {
        "claim_id": f"CLM-{random.randint(100000, 999999)}",
        "patient_id": f"PAT-{random.randint(1000, 9999)}", 
        "diagnosis": random.choice(SYNTHETIC_DIAGNOSES),
        "amount": round(random.uniform(100, 5000), 2),
        "provider": f"Provider-{random.randint(1, 100)}"
    }
```

### **Audit & Documentation**
- **Security Documentation**: Maintained in `/docs/SECURITY.md`
- **Change Tracking**: All security-related changes documented in git history
- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly security review and updates
- **Compliance Evidence**: Automated collection of security metrics and controls

**Security is everyone's responsibility.** When in doubt about security implications, ask questions and err on the side of caution. Our goal is to demonstrate enterprise-grade AI implementations with security practices that organizations can trust and adopt.

**Questions?** Contact the security team or create a GitHub discussion for security-related questions that don't involve vulnerabilities.
