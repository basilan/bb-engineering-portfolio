# üîí Security Analysis

**BB DevOps Portfolio - Complete Security Controls and Compliance**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework

This implementation follows **Defense in Depth** principles with multiple layers of security controls across network, host, application, and monitoring layers.

### Threat Model

**Assets Protected**:
- AWS infrastructure and resources
- Application data and configurations  
- SSH keys and access credentials
- CloudWatch logs and metrics

**Threat Actors**:
- External attackers (internet-based)
- Insider threats (credential compromise)
- Automated attacks (bots, scanners)
- Supply chain attacks (compromised dependencies)

## üåê Network Security

### Infrastructure Level

**VPC Isolation**:
- Dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (10.0.0.0/16)
- Public subnet for internet-facing resources only
- Private subnets for sensitive components (future expansion)
- Internet Gateway with controlled routing

**Security Groups (Stateful Firewall)**:
```
Inbound Rules:
- SSH (22): Restricted to specified CIDR blocks
- HTTP (80): 0.0.0.0/0 (redirects to HTTPS)  
- HTTPS (443): 0.0.0.0/0

Outbound Rules:
- All traffic: 0.0.0.0/0 (for updates and monitoring)
```

### Host Level Firewall

**UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**:
- Default deny policy for all inbound traffic
- Selective port opening for required services
- Rate limiting for SSH connections
- Logging enabled for security monitoring

## üîê Access Control

### SSH Security

**Key-Based Authentication**:
- Public key authentication required
- Password authentication disabled
- Root login disabled
- SSH key rotation supported

**Connection Security**:
- Strong encryption algorithms only
- Connection rate limiting
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Session timeout configuration

### Privilege Management

**User Account Security**:
- Non-root user for application processes
- Sudo access with logging
- Service accounts with minimal privileges
- Regular access review procedures

## üö® Intrusion Detection & Prevention

### Fail2Ban Configuration

**SSH Protection**:
- Automatic IP blocking after failed attempts
- Progressive ban duration (exponential backoff)
- Email notifications for security events
- Integration with CloudWatch logging

**Web Server Protection**:
- HTTP request rate limiting
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Automated blocking of malicious IPs
- Real-time alert generation

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Security Event Detection**:
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Unusual network activity detection
- File integrity monitoring
- Process anomaly detection

**Automated Response**:
- Immediate IP blocking for brute force attacks
- Email notifications for critical events
- CloudWatch alarm integration
- Automatic incident logging

## üîí Application Security

### Web Server Hardening

**Nginx Security Configuration**:
```nginx
# Security Headers
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;
add_header Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;

# Server Information Hiding
server_tokens off;
more_set_headers "Server: ";

# SSL/TLS Configuration
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
```

### Content Security

**Static Content Protection**:
- Content-Type validation
- File upload restrictions (not applicable in this implementation)
- Directory traversal prevention
- Executable content blocking

**HTTP Security Headers**:
- **HSTS**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **CSP**: Controls resource loading sources
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information sharing

## üìä Compliance & Standards

### CIS Benchmarks Implementation

**Level 1 Controls** (Implemented):
- Account and Password Policy
- System File Permissions
- Network Configuration Security
- Logging and Monitoring
- System Maintenance

**Specific CIS Controls**:
- 2.1.1: Ensure xinetd is not installed
- 2.2.1: Ensure time synchronization is in use
- 3.1.1: Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled
- 4.1.1: Ensure auditing is enabled
- 5.1.1: Ensure cron daemon is enabled

### Security Testing

**Automated Security Scans**:
- Terraform security analysis (tfsec)
- Ansible playbook security validation
- Infrastructure penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning

**Manual Security Reviews**:
- Configuration review checklist
- Access control verification
- Network security validation
- Incident response testing

## üîç Audit & Logging

### Log Collection Strategy

**System Logs**:
- Authentication events (auth.log)
- System events (syslog)
- Kernel events (kern.log)
- Application events (nginx logs)

**CloudWatch Integration**:
- Real-time log streaming
- Log retention policies (30 days)
- Search and analysis capabilities
- Automated alerting on suspicious patterns

### Audit Trail Components

**Infrastructure Changes**:
- Terraform state changes
- Resource creation/modification/deletion
- Cost impact tracking

**Configuration Changes**:
- Ansible playbook execution logs
- Configuration drift detection
- Service restart events

**Security Events**:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Firewall rule violations
- Intrusion detection alerts
- File integrity violations

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools & Services

### AWS Security Services

**Identity & Access Management**:
- IAM roles with least privilege
- AWS CloudTrail for API logging
- AWS Config for compliance monitoring

**Network Security**:
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- AWS GuardDuty (recommended for production)
- AWS WAF (for web application firewall)

**Data Protection**:
