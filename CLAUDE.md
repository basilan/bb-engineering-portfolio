# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a portfolio meta-repository that serves as a curated index of enterprise-grade AI and software engineering reference implementations. It does not contain actual code implementations but rather serves as documentation and links to separate project repositories.

## Architecture

**Portfolio Structure:**
- This repository contains documentation and references to external projects
- Actual implementations are maintained in separate repositories (Cuyo, BiriGov, etc.)
- Each referenced project follows enterprise patterns for AI, DevSecOps, and platform engineering

**Key Projects Referenced:**
- **Cuyo**: AI-powered job search workspace (external repo: github.com/basilan/cuyo)
- **BiriGov**: AI governance monitoring system (external repo: github.com/basilan/birigov, in development)

## Development Context

Since this is a documentation-only portfolio repository, typical development commands (build, test, lint) are not applicable. When working with this repository:

- Focus on maintaining clear, professional documentation
- Ensure all external project links remain accurate and functional
- Follow the established tone: enterprise-focused, senior-level technical audience
- Maintain the thematic naming convention (Philippine islands) for new projects

## Content Guidelines

- Projects should only be added when they are "ready for external consumption" (scoped, tested, documented)
- Each project entry should include purpose, key features, and symbolic meaning of the island name
- Maintain the balance between technical depth and accessibility for enterprise decision-makers
